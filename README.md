## About The LIRI Bot

The LIRI Bot is an application that utilizes node.js to target API's and provide information in several categories.

    * Band performance dates
    * Spotify song information
    * Movie Information

The LIRI Bot is also intuitive in that it has additional default functionality which will allows the user to access information if they forget to add information in the search field, or if they perform certain additional requests. 

## Why LIRI?

LIRI allows a user to access entertainment information in various categories in **one place**. This application allows users to solve all of their show buisiness needs with ease.
