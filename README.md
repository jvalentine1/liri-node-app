## About The LIRI Bot

The LIRI Bot is an application that utilizes node.js to target API's and provide information in several categories.

    * Band performance dates
    * Spotify song information
    * Movie Information

The LIRI Bot is also intuitive in that it has additional default functionality which will allows the user to access information if they forget to add information in the search field, or if they perform certain additional requests.
